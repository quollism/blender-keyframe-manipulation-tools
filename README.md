# blender-keyframetools

Some handy tools for working with keyframes in Blender. Inspired by Alan Camilo's animBot.

## Limitations

This software is in its very very very very early stages. It is offered here because people on Twitter were all like "wow this looks awesome i want to try it". And it's even a little bit useful!

**Note**: This tool doesn't work for all types of F-Curves yet. Bones and object-level animation are good to go as of 0.5.0 but properties in materials, the scene and the world don't respond to these tools yet because they're in a different part of the API. (Hopefully this weird state of affairs gets fixed in Blender 2.8's Python API.)

**Only in development for 2.79b, does not work in 2.8 yet. 2.8 is wonderful though, isn't it?**

## Functions

All current functions are for the Graph Editor only.

### Keyframe manipulating tools

All of these should work with multiple bone channels and object-level animation. Material values and scene-level 

* **Flatten Keyframes** (hotkey Ctrl+A): Non-interactively flattens selected keyframes to a straight line between the first and last keyframe of the selection. Useful for tidying up. Works on multiple channels. Shortcut: Shift+A
* **Flatten/Exaggerate Keyframes** (hotkey D): Interactively flattens or exaggerates selected keyframes along a straight line between the first and last keyframe of the selection. Useful for making a motion smaller or bigger. Also works on multiple channels. 
* **Ease Keyframes** (hotkey Shift+A): Interactively create an ease in or ease out for a selection of keyframes. Useful for tidying up an ease pattern. Also works on multiple channels. 

### Shortcut tool

* **Place Cursor and Pivot** (hotkey Ctrl+Shift+G): Places the 2D Cursor at the selection and changes Pivot Center to 2D Cursor. Like Ctrl+G but better.

### Pie menu

The pie menu is bound to Shift+Z. This gives you Ease Keys, Flatten Keys, Flatten/Exaggerate Keys and Place Cursor and Pivot.

### Changing hotkeys

If you don't like the hotkeys, you can always change them in the keymap!

* Go to File -> User Preferences -> Input
* Change the Search mode to Key Binding, then type in the hotkey Z.
* Scroll down to "Graph Editor" and look for the hotkey in question by function. (Note: The pie menu is disguised as "Call Pie Menu", see the pie menu setup graphic for how it should look)
* To change the hotkey, hit the > to the left and change the key to whatever you like. To get rid of the shortcut, click the big X.

Don't forget to save your user preferences afterwards! (Hint: click **Save User Settings** at the bottom left.)

You can also access the functions from the Space Bar. (2.8 is not supported yet.)

## Roadmap

These are the current priorities as of version 0.5.1 (28 October 2018)

### Coming Keyframe-Related Additions

* Smooth Rough tool from animBot (will be called Dampen/Excite)
* More stuff depending on what Looch thinks is useful :)

### Coming Other Changes and Fixes

* All: Make all F-Curve types manipulable, including properties belonging to materials, scenes and worlds.
* Ease: Do something more helpful with out-of-bounds keys 
* Share Keys: Make it work again

Work on Blender 2.8 compatibility will begin after 2.8 API is declared stable by the Blender devs, maybe November?
